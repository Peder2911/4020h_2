In this assignment, i reproduce the results from 
@laver_extracting_2003, and elaborate on the findings
with a couple of examples. Additionally, i fit a 
Wordfish model on the same data, and compare the two 
modelling approaches.

# Wordscores and wordfish

Both Wordscores [@laver_extracting_2003] and Wordfish
[@slapin_scaling_2008] are approaches to the problem
of estimating unobserved characteristics about text,
using pre-classified training cases.

In this case, the approaches are illustrated using
political texts, and with estimating ideological 
positions 

# Estimating wordscores

```{R fitting,include = FALSE,echo = FALSE}
man_dfm <- dfm(man)
man_dfm_t <- man_dfm[1:50,]
man_dfm_ts <- man_dfm[51:nrow(man_dfm),]

ws_fit <- textmodel_wordscores(man_dfm_t,
                               y = rep(0,nrow(man_dfm)))
ws_pred <- predict(ws_fit,
                   newdata = man_dfm_ts,
                   rescaling = 'lbg')
```
